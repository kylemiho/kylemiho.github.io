    <!-- Summary -->
    <p class = 'text textTitle'>Summary</p><br>
    <p class = 'text textP'> This Project involved recreating the classic Bomberman game onto an embedded system. Shift registers were used to expand the amount of pins usable for the game. A mixture of a Saga Genesis Controller as well as standard buttons were used as input. An 8x8 RGB LED Matrix was used as output. A video demonstration of the project is shown below.</p>

    <p class = 'text textTitle'>Conclusion</p><br>
    <p class = 'text textP'> The main struggle of this project was code organization as it got larger. If oykylue check the code for this project, you can tell how a lot of variable names were not very useful and a lot of code was reused, showing that functions should have been used more often to help simplify the code structure. 1387 lines of code all in one file is a nightmare to look through. Although the project was a success, it showcases the importance of clean code.</p>
